Gender Prediction of Authors of Children's books using Sound

## Objective
---
There are many words that are pronounced the same way but have different spellings. While it is easy for us to realize their equivalence, basic programming commands will fail to equate such two strings.One way to tackle this challenge is to write a program that checks if two strings sound the same, instead of checking for equivalence in spellings.
---
This is achieved using the Fuzzy module to check for similar sounding words and performing database matching
